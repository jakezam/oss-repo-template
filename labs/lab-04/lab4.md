## This Lab (2/19/2021) is on Open Source Licensing.

Some good reading materials are [OSI's License page](http://opensource.org/licenses) and the [class lecture notes] (https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4470-OpenSource/blob/master/Modules/04.Licensing/Licensing-S2021-RPI-PatrickMasson.pdf)

### All of the steps below should be recorded in a github file `Lab4.md` in your Labs directory

1. https://github.com/jakezam/oss-repo-template/blob/master/LICENSE

1. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

   - A LICENSE for an open source project is the key tool that turns code into an open source project. It specifies to any users that they may legally use these components of software in their own projects or products under certain conditions. This clears up any legal issues and creates an agreement between the open source author and the user of their code to allow them to truly use the code.

1. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

   - A project without a license is not truly open source. A license is an agreement by the author to allow users to use their code for commercial or personal projects without any legal issues. However, if there is no license on a public repo then there is no specification on how a user can use the code, and the author can take the project away for use of their code.

1. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of [Why the Web beat Gopher](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain).

   - I do not agree with the direction the Gopher team decided to go with. Open source software is strongly focused on the community of developers and the ideas they have as well. By trying to control what the users want and build the whole project at once takes away the community development aspect of open source software and just gives a finished product to the community.

1. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).

   - I think the MIT license is a very understandable choice for Microsofts .NET Core. The focus of Microsofts .NET Core is to be a free platform/library that anyone can develop with for any sort of application in any industry. A developer can really create any app they want using the platform and they do not charge developers or force them to do a ton of copyright information. That's why the MIT license is super fitting as it is one of the most basic licenses permitting any sort of development with it, including commerical/personal use, distribution and modifications. The .NET Core community is very interactive as well with a very active github repositories of other developers making contributions for everyone elses benefit.

1. As a table, make up an open source project and a **_business model_** that you could use to make money from it.

1. Take 5 projects from [Observatory](http://rcos.io/projects) or [past RCOS Projects](https://rcos.io/projects/past) and create a table for which project has which license. for example:

| Website                                      | License Present | License                                                                                  |
