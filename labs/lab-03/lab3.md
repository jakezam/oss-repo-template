# Lab 3 Documentation and Community Development - June 7, 2019

## This Lab has two parts [Documentation](#part-1) and [Community](#part-2)

#### We talked about community and how people cooperate in order to contribute to a project. In this lab, we will explore this further using automatic tools, software and manually.

> This lab will be done in groups of 4-5. Each will be assigned a table number

> All the results should be documented in a `Lab3.md` and pushed to in your Github account.

### Part 1 - Documentation

1. Use latex [http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/texer](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/texer) to generate the formulae depicted in [https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4961-01-Summer-2018/blob/master/Labs/latex_formulae.png](https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4961-01-Summer-2018/blob/master/Labs/latex_formulae.png)

1. Use latex to display a [Hadamard Matrix of size 4](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HadamardMatrix.html) (equation 5). You can use just 1 and -1; although, if you want to make a matrix using the white and black boxes you are welcome to.

1. Gitstats

   - Gitstats show tons of additional statistics for the repo of your choice, and it seems to be more accurate. It shows all authors and their commits, who is commiting most and when they are doing so, as well as every file, line, and bunch of code ordered by author contribution.

   > If you are curious, please read and try to understand the [python code for gitstats](https://github.com/hoxu/gitstats/blob/master/gitstats). (Its even better if you suggest some improvements!)
